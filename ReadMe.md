# futurerestore
_futurerestore is a hacked up idevicerestore wrapper, which allows manually specifying SEP and Baseband for restoring._

__Only use if you are sure what you're doing.__
---
Latest release available [here](https://github.com/s0uthwest/futurerestore/releases) for macOS & Windows. I'll compile only macOS/Windows versions, Linux version won't be compiled by me.

## Features
* Supports the following downgrade methods:
  * Prometheus 64-bit devices (generator and ApNonce collision mode);
  * Odysseus for 32-bit devices;
  * Re-restoring 32-bit devices to iOS 9 with [alitek123](https://github.com/alitek12) no-ApNonce method (alternative — [idevicererestore](https://github.com/s0uthwest/idevicererestore)).
* Allows restoring any non-matching signed iOS/SEP/Baseband.

__NOT recommended to use '-u' parameter, if you update jailbroken firmware!__

## Report an issue
You can do it [here](https://github.com/s0uthwest/futurerestore/issues).

### Restoring on Windows 10
1.  Try to restore the device, error -8 occurs;
2.  Leave the device plugged in, it'll stay on the Recovery screen;
3.  Head over to device manager under control panel in Windows;
4.  Locate "Apple Recovery (iBoot) USB Composite Device" (at the bottom);
5.  Right click and choose "Uninstall device".
    You may see a tick box that allows you to uninstall the driver software as well, tick that (all the three Apple mobile device entries under USB devices will disappear);
6.  Unplug the device and re-plug it in;
7.  Go back to futurerestore and send the restore command again (just press the up arrow to get it back, then enter).
    Error -8 is now fixed, but the process will fail again after the screen of your device has turned green;
8.  Go back to device manager and repeat the driver uninstall process as described above (step 4 to 6);
9.  Go back to futurerestore once again and repeat the restore process;
10. The device will reboot and error -10 will also be solved;
11. The restore will now proceed and succeed.
  
## Compiling
Simple use  `bash autogen.sh && make` or use Xcode project. For installing use `make install`.
  
### Some about [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl)
  * Linux: Follow [this guide](https://dev.to/jake/using-libcurl3-and-libcurl4-on-ubuntu-1804-bionic-184g) to use tsschecker on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) as it requires libcurl3 which cannot coexist with libcurl4 on this OS.
  * macOS: open file [Makefile.am](https://github.com/s0uthwest/futurerestore/blob/master/futurerestore/Makefile.am) and update line with LDADD: `futurerestore_LDADD = $(AM_LDFLAGS) libjssy.a /usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib`

## 0) What futurerestore can do
**Downgrade/Upgrade/Re-restore _same_ iOS.**
Whenever you read "downgrade" nowadays it means you can also upgrade and re-restore if you're on the same iOS. Basically this allows restoring an iOS and the installed iOS doesn't matter.

## 1) Prometheus (64-bit device) - generator method

### Requirements
- __Jailbreak;__
- Signing tickets (.shsh2) files with a generator;
- nonceEnabler patch enabled (on iOS 11 and later it's enabled automatically);

### How to use
1. Device must be jailbroken and nonceEnabler patch must be active;
2. Open signing ticket and look up the generator:
  * Looks like this: `<key>generator</key><string>0xde3318d224cf14a1</string>`;
3. Write the boot-nonce generator to device's nvram (latest jailbreaks'll (for iOS 11+) unlocking nvram after setting boot-nonce):
  * SSH into the device and run `nvram com.apple.System.boot-nonce=0xde3318d224cf14a1` to set the boot-nonce generator *0xde3318d224cf14a1*;
  * verify with `nvram -p` command

### Recommended methods to activate nonceEnabler patch
#### Method 1: ios-kern-utils (iOS 7.x-10.x):
1. Install DEB-file of [ios-kern-utils](https://github.com/Siguza/ios-kern-utils/releases/) on device;
2. Run on the device `nvpatch com.apple.System.boot-nonce`.

#### Method 2: Using special applications
Use utilities for setting boot-nonce generator:
1. [PhœnixNonce](https://github.com/Siguza/PhoenixNonce) for iOS 9.x;
2. [v0rtexnonce](https://github.com/arx8x/v0rtexnonce) for iOS 10.x;
3. [Nonceset1112](https://github.com/julioverne/NonceSet112) for iOS 11.0-11.1.2;
4. [noncereboot1131UI](https://github.com/s0uthwest/noncereboot1131UI) for iOS 11.0-11.4b3;
5. [NonceReboot12xx](https://github.com/ur0/NonceReboot12XX) for iOS 12.0-12.1.2.

#### Method 3: Using jailbreak tools
Use jailbreak tools for setting boot-nonce generator:
1. [Meridian](https://meridian.sparkes.zone) for iOS 10.x;
2. [backr00m](https://nito.tv) or greeng0blin for tvOS 10.2-11.1;
3. [Electra and ElectraTV](https://coolstar.org/electra) for iOS and tvOS 11.x;
4. [unc0ver](https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/releases) for iOS 11.0-12.1.2;
5. [Chimera and ChimeraTV](https://chimera.sh) for iOS 12.0-12.1.2 and tvOS 12.0-12.1.1.

### Activate tfp0 if jailbreak doesn't allow it
#### Method 1 (if jailbroken on 9.2-9.3.x)
  * reboot;
  * reactivate jailbreak with [Luca Todesco](https://github.com/kpwn)'s [JailbreakMe](https://jbme.qwertyoruiop.com/);
  * done.
  
#### Method 2 (if jailbroken on iOS 8.0-8.1 with [Pangu8](https://en.8.pangu.io))
  * install this [untether DEB-file](http://apt.saurik.com/beta/pangu8-tfp0/io.pangu.xuanyuansword8_0.5_iphoneos-arm.deb) with included tfp0 patch
  
#### Method 3 (if jailbroken on iOS 7.x with [Pangu7](https://en.7.pangu.io))
  * install this [untether DEB-file](http://apt.saurik.com/debs/io.pangu.axe7_0.3_iphoneos-arm.deb) with included tfp0 patch

#### Method 4
  * Use [cl0ver](https://github.com/Siguza/cl0ver) for iOS 9.x.

## 2) Prometheus (64-bit device) - ApNonce collision method (Recovery mode);

### Requirements
- __iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2 (devices with A7 chip) on iOS 9.2 — 10.2 (10.3b1);__
- Jailbreak doesn't required;
- Signing tickets (.shsh, .shsh2) with customly chosen ApNonce;
- Ticket needs to have one of the ApNonces, which the device generates a lot;
- __collisioned ApNonces available in file 'nonces.txt' in [TSSChecker](https://github.com/s0uthwest/tsschecker) project.__

### How to use
1. Connect your device in normal / recovery mode;
2. On the computer run `futurerestore -w -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep ios.ipsw`.
* If you have saved multiple tickets with different ApNonces you can specify more than
one to speed up the process: `futurerestore -w -t t1.shsh -t t2.shsh -t t3.shsh -t t4.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep ios.ipsw`.

## 3) Prometheus (64-bit device) - ApNonce collision method (DFU mode);

### Requirements
- __Devices with A7 (iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2), A8 (iPhone 6 [+], iPad mini [2,3,4], iPod touch [6th generation]) and A8X (iPad Air 2) chips on all iOS firmwares;__
- __Devices have been released after ~September, 2015;__
- Jailbreak doesn't required;
- Signing tickets (.shsh, .shsh2) with customly chosen ApNonce;
- Ticket needs to have one of the ApNonces, which the device generates a lot;
- __[img4tool](https://github.com/s0uthwest/img4tool) can't be used for Windows [problem with signing iBSS/iBEC], now it's TO-DO;__
- __collisioned ApNonces available in file 'nonces.txt' in [TSSChecker](https://github.com/s0uthwest/tsschecker) project.__

### How to use
1. Connect your device in DFU mode;
2. Use [irecovery](https://github.com/s0uthwest/libirecovery) for checking ApNonce, which booted in DFU;
3. Extract iBSS/iBEC from target firmware for downgrade (unsigned);
4. Check DFU-collisioned ApNonces with [irecovery](https://github.com/s0uthwest/irecovery/releases), which booted in DFU.
    You can't automatically collision DFU ApNonces.
    
    __If ApNonce is not collisioned, "use hands" for DFU booting.__
    
    __If ApNonce is successfully coliisioned, use this SHSH2 for sign iBSS/iBEC.__
5. Use [img4tool](https://github.com/s0uthwest/img4tool/releases) for sign iBSS:
   `img4tool -s ticket.shsh -c iBSS.signed -p <original_iBSS>`;
6. Use [img4tool](https://github.com/s0uthwest/img4tool/releases) for sign iBEC:
   `img4tool -s ticket.shsh -c iBEC.signed -p <original_iBEC>`;
7. So, after signing we can boot into Recovery with [irecovery](https://github.com/s0uthwest/libirecovery/releases):

   `irecovery -f iBSS.signed` - loading iBSS;
   
   `irecovery -f iBEC.signed` - loading iBEC;
8. So good! On the computer run `futurerestore -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband --latest-sep -w ios.ipsw`.

## 4) Odysseus (32-bit devices)

### Requirements
- futurerestore compiled with [libipatcher](https://github.com/s0uthwest/libipatcher) ([Odysseus](https://dayt0n.com/articles/Odysseus) method support);
- Jailbreak or bootROM exploit (limera1n);
- Firmware keys for the device/destination iOS must be public;
- Signing tickets (.shsh, .shsh2) for the destination iOS (OTA blobs work too!);
- _Odysseus bundle (You can use any successfully created bundle for this)._

### How to use
1. Get device into kDFU/pwnDFU mode:
  * limera1n devices:
    * Enter pwnDFU mode with redsn0w or any other tool;
  * Other 32-bit devices:
    * Jailbreak required;
    * Enter kDFU mode by loading a pwnediBSS from any existing Odysseus bundle.
2. Connect your device to computer in kDFU / pwnDFU mode;
3. On the computer run `futurerestore --use-pwndfu -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband ios.ipsw`

---

## 5) iOS 9 Re-restore bug (found by [@alitek123](https://github.com/alitek12), 32-bit devices only):
### Requirements
- Jailbreak doesn't required;
- __Signing tickets (.shsh, .shsh2) without a ApNonce (noNonce APTickets);__

### Info
If you have signing tickets for iOS 9.x which do not contain an ApNonce, you can restore to that firmware.

### How to use
1. Connect your device in DFU mode;
2. On the computer run `futurerestore -t ticket.shsh --latest-baseband ios9.ipsw`
